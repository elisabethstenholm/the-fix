# The Fix

**The Fix** is inspired by [*The Fuck*](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) but
uses OpenAI to generate corrections, rather than rules.

## Usage

If you write an incorrect console command, you simply invoke The Fix by typing
`fix` and it will generate suggestions of commands you may have wished to write.
You can then choose to execute one of these commands, or ignore the suggestions.
